# Alexa
Alexa, a virtual assistant technology largely based on a Polish speech synthesiser named Ivona, bought by Amazon in 2013.
It was first used in the Amazon Echo smart speaker and the Echo Dot, Echo Studio and Amazon Tap speakers developed by Amazon Lab126.
Its operating system(OS) started with FireOS then came to IOS ended via Android but here is the point to build the one.

## Installation

For installing we need some Py Modules like pyttsx3,speech Recognition,pywhatkit,wikipedia,pyjokes

### Windows
For the robot to listen to our voice/speech `pip install speechRecognition`

To speak out, or text to speech `pip install pyttsx3`

For advance control on browser `pip install pywhatkit`

To get wikipedia data `pip install wikipedia`

To get funny jokes `pip install pyjokes`

### Linux
Before installing that, Python is usually installed on most linux distributions but we have to upgrade it to Python3 using :

`sudo apt update`

And then upgrade all the packages

`sudo apt upgrade`

After upgrading pip will be defected to pip3 which is what we want
Then as on Windows us the same but we have to install this too :

`pip3 install pyAudio`

And in case of reaching any errors : `pip3 install portAudio`
